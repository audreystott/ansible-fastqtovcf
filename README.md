# Automated FastQ-to-VCF tools deployment

The FastQ-to-VCF pipeline incorporates two pipelines from the Sydney Informatics Hub: [Fastq-to-BAM](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/Fastq-to-BAM) and [Germline-ShortV](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/Germline-ShortV).

The automated deployment of tools for the FastQ-to-VCF pipeline consist of first checking if the tools are available as modules on the central system, and to automatically install those that are not.
